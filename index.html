				What We Do
			</h2>
			<p class="measure-wide">
				Conservation projects take a long time. They are usually funded by grants and one-time donations—these are great, but they do not last. The go-to solution for this problem is to ask people for recurring donations. This is great, but very few people can afford to do this.</p>

			<p class="measure-wide">
			According to the <a href="http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/42-of-americans-cant-afford-to-give/" class="no-underline black-70 hover-mid-gray">NonProfit Times</a>, 9 out of 10 people say they would donate to nonprofits if they had more money. These people want to help, but currently, there isn’t much they can do other than raise awareness. To fund all the great conservation projects in the world, we need to tap into the 90 percent of people who do not donate. Unfortunately, raising awareness, which most people do by sharing a link on Facebook, doesn’t accomplish much. There has to be something better they can do. We think we’ve found it.</p>

			<p class="measure-wide">
			Imagine if just by browsing the internet, you can fund conservation projects. People spend hours each day on the internet, in the process, viewing at least a hundred ads each day. Adonis replaces one ad on every webpage you visit with an ad from a patron. Instead of paying ad networks to display their ads, these patrons would pay us. All the profits would go to conservation projects. <span class="black-70">This means that by simply browsing the web, you are, in a tangible way, helping to stop animal trafficking and protect the environment.</span>

				</div>

				<p class="measure-wide">These ads aren’t like regular ads you would normally see. They aren’t for any product from some company, instead, they are facts about endangered wildlife, pictures of cute animals, or any content you’d like to see. The only sign of commercialization is the small message we include at the bottom, to thank our patrons for their generosity and to let you know who they are.
				</p>

				<p class="measure-wide">These ads respect your privacy and your time. They are lightweight, unobstrusive, and will never track your browsing behavior. You can choose to see facts about endangered wildlife, fun facts about animals, pictures of cute animals, or all of them. The choice is all yours.</p>

			<p class="measure-wide">
				Normally, companies pay ad networks to display their ads on webpages. Adonis replaces one of those ads, and shows ads from our patrons instead. These patrons pay us to display ads and the money we receive goes to partner conservation organizations directly. <span class="black-70">This means that by installing Adonis and browsing the web, you are funding conservation projects without paying a single dollar.</span>
			</p>

			<p class="measure-wide">
				<span class="black-70">Additionally, this is completely legal.</span> Adonis works inside your browser and only replaces ads for you—it will not affect anyone else. Unlike AdBlock, we do not block ads. This means that websites still get the money they deserve from ads.
